// The new "Avengers" movie has just been released! There are a lot of people 
// at the cinema box office standing in a huge line. Each of them has a single 
// 100, 50 or 25 dollars bill. A "Avengers" ticket costs 25 dollars.

// Vasya is currently working as a clerk. He wants to sell a ticket to every 
// single person in this line.

// Can Vasya sell a ticket to each person and give the change if he initially 
// has no money and sells the tickets strictly in the order people follow in the line?

// Return YES, if Vasya can sell a ticket to each person and give the change. 
// Otherwise return NO.

// ###Examples:

// // === JavaScript ==

// tickets([25, 25, 50]) // => YES 
// tickets([25, 100])    
//         // => NO. Vasya will not have enough money to give change to
